# Exploring-the-Canadian-Education-Landscape

##Introduction
The field of education is a vital component of any society's development and growth. Canada is known for its quality education system and attracts students from all over the world. In this analysis, I will use data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to explore various aspects of the Canadian Education landscape. With the use of both Python and Tableau, I will delve into the correlations between international students, enrollment by province/gender, annual growth rate, and investment in education. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the Canadian Education system and identify areas for improvement. By combining the powerful data analysis capabilities of Python and the intuitive visualization capabilities of Tableau, I will present a comprehensive picture of the Canadian Education landscape and a few other countries in comparison.
